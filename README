# EEE3088F Micromouse Power Subsystem

This repository contains the collaborative hardware design files and documentation for the **Power Subsystem** of the 2025 EEE3088F Micromouse Project at the University of Cape Town.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The EEE3088F Micromouse project challenges students to design submodules for a maze-solving robot. Our task focused on building the **Power Module** that supplies and regulates power to all other subsystems, including:

- **Bidirectional motor control** (4 motors: 2x 200mA, 2x 500mA)
- **USB-C PD negotiation** to 9V input
- **Battery charging** with two selectable current modes (200mA and ~600mA)
- **Battery monitoring** using the INA219 over I2C
- **External load switching** (2x 1A High Side switches)
- **3.3V and 5V voltage regulation**
- **Ultra-low power OFF mode** via a system-wide ON/OFF switch

All PCB designs were implemented under strict **budget** and **size** constraints: 
- Component budget: **$56.50**
- PCB size: **max 82mm x 60mm**
- Compliance with JLCPCB fabrication requirements
